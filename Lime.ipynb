    "\n",
    "### This concrete example:\n",
    "- The MLP Model predicts with 73 likelihood that this instance is a \"0\", in our case a male.\n",
    "- The feature that supports the prediction are \"num_Weight\", \"cat_Race_-\" and \"cat_Alignment_good\".\n",
    "- The value 1.16 indicates the gradient/slope linear model that approximates the model at the vicinity of our randomly chosen instance X. Thus, this resembles the impact of that feature mathematically on the prediciton target.\n",
    "- Despite many feature sshow an orange indication, supporting the prediction of a Female, the final prediciton is still pretty sure of a male. This indicates that the feature \"num_Weight\" has higher weight in the linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General:\n",
    "Understanding the subtle connection between superhero traits and their alignment relies heavily on explanations. By utilizing Lime, we were able to gain understandings of this complex relationship through the examination of our model's forecasts. For example, our classifier provided probabilities showing the chance of a superhero being male or female. Lime's explanations helped us explore further the connection between alignment, a key trait, and different physical attributes and superpowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The examination of Lime uncovered convincing trends. For example, superheroes with particular physical characteristics, such as brown hair, from the human race and a specific height, tended to be bad. These results shed light on how superhero traits and their alignment interact, revealing the factors that impact a superhero's moral direction."

    "\n",
    "1. Data Import: The data must be read into pandas dataframe with the right configuration so that after the ColumnTransformer a Pandas dataframe is returned. In my case, a numpy array was returned that caused errors.\n",
    "2. Cleaning NaN: During this stage, the test data y still had NaN values. This caused problems, too, so we had to change that.\n",
    "3. Preprocessing: Although we did preprocessing in the first place for the model training, we need to do it again for this stage because the X_train and X_test data is still unprocessed. Not doing this created errors since LIME only takes numerical values in the explainer\n",
    "4. Calling explainer instance: Since we transformed the X_train data to a Pandas dataframe, we had to use iloc when calling the explainer instance. "

    "As long as superheroes have been in the market, they have almost always been targeted at little boys. Seldom did we find a superhero whose main target was girls, as finding little girls who were interested in the diverse world of Superheroes was strange and sometimes judged. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, kids like superheroes because they represent both incredible powers and someone they could dream of becoming. Consequently, since superheroes were targeted at little boys, most superheroes were always men. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in recent years, companies have discovered they were missing out on a great market by not targeting little girls as well. As a result, more and more female superheroes have appeared. \n",

    "As AC movie producers, we not only recognize the immense potential of female superheroes but also understand the crucial role of strong supernatural abilities and visually stunning effects in their success and popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, our proposal is to conduct a comprehensive study on the different female superheroes and their most popular powers. This research will enable us to budget and perfect special effects in the coming years, ensuring we are fully prepared for a potential saga, including an appealing list of all-female superheroes."
